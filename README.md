<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
Tech Prali is a Java-based application. This app is primarily designed for buying and selling of smartphone.The Login page is the first thing the user sees when they open this application. If the user has already registered, they may simply log in with their username and password, or they can sign up by selecting the sign up option. After logging into the app, the user will be taken to the main screen, where a buy panel has already been launched, displaying smartphone data supplied by other users. There are four panels in total: buy, sell, details, and profile. Users can put their own smartphone to the sale panel if they want to sell it. In the details section, you can see the specifics of the smartphone that the user has added, which can be deleted by typing the smartphone's id, which is a unique id.The user's information can be edited and updated via the profile section. All of the data processing was done on the MySQL server.
